# Stock-Market-Analysis-and-Prediction-using-LSTM
Stock Market Analysis and Prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks utilize LSTM's ability to capture temporal dependencies, ideal for time series forecasting. Historical stock price data is fed into the LSTM, which learns patterns to predict future prices. LSTMs retain long-term information and handle the vanishing gradient problem.
